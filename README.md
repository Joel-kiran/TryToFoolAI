# TryToFoolAI

Scripts folder contains three scripts 
1. resize_images.py - which is used to resize the image to the desired dimensions as part of preprocessing
2. Tensorflow_Project_1_with_keras_pre.ipynb - it used to train the model using tensorflow v2.
3. fool_ai.ipynb - its the main file which starts from preprocessing the image followed by training the model followed by predicition followed by adding the three adversarial noises and comparing the accuracy.
